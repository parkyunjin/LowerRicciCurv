# Lower Ricci Curvature for Efficient Community Detection
## Overview
This is a repository for a paper "Lower Ricci Curvature for Efficient Community Detection" preprinted in 2024. 

This study introduces the Lower Ricci Curvature (LRC), a novel, scalable, and scale-free discrete curvature designed to enhance community detection in networks. Addressing the computational challenges posed by existing curvature-based methods, LRC offers a streamlined approach with linear computational complexity, making it well-suited for large-scale network analysis. We further develop an LRC-based preprocessing method that effectively augments popular community detection algorithms. Through comprehensive simulations and applications on real- world datasets, including the NCAA football league network, the DBLP collaboration network, the Amazon product co-purchasing network, and the YouTube social network, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in significantly improving the performance of various community detection algorithms.
